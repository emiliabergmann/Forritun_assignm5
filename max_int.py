# Design an algorithm that finds the maximum positive integer input by a user.  
# The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.
 
# Make sure that you write up the algorithm before starting to code.
# Then implement the algorithm in Python. Put your algorithmic description as a comment in the program file.

#1. Start by getting an input from the user.
#2. Create a constant that holds the highes number, starting at 0.
#3. Use a while loop to repeatly ask the user for a number until he enters a negative value.
